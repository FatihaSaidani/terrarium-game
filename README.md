A virtual terrarium game, that allows you to create your own terrarium, endlessly. 

This game was created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It has been created as part of my learning process.
Alongside the code, I have included comments to explain the code, and this can be used for learning/referring to the basics of the languages.
